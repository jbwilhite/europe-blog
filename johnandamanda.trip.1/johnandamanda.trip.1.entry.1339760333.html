      <!-- STORY -->
      <div class="post">
        <p class="entry_text">   Belgium: the land of Beer, Chocolate, Waffles, and Fries.<br><br>London is roughly the size of New York, Paris is close to Chicago, Bruges (Brugge in Dutch) is similar in size and feel to Charleston or Savannah. The coast is a few miles away, but the historic center of Brugge is medieval buildings, cobblestone streets, and canals.  But before we could get to Brugge, we had a few difficulties along the way.<br><br>Our last morning in Paris, we made it to the train station fairly early.  After standing in the wrong line for 20 minutes, we were directed to the correct line, which had a 1 hour wait.  When we got to the counter, we were told our railpasses did not cover the train to Brussels. We would have to pay full price for the high speed train leaving in 15 minutes, or wait and get on local trains with a several convoluted transfers. The two women at the counter didn't give us much choice and were barely understandable, so we reluctantly paid the &#8364;60 for the high speed train.<br><br>When we got to Brussels, we knew there were a few sights we wanted to see.  Amanda and I both have a good sense of direction and don't often get lost, but we found Belgium very confusing. We had no trouble with the London Underground or the Paris Metro, but the trains, subways, and buses in Belgium gave us a great amount of difficulty.  We had to search the subway station in Brussels a good fifteen minutes before we found a line map. Then we entered the stop going the wrong direction and there was no way to change directions without going completely out (and wasting our ticket). In every other city, you enter and then pick the direction.  Once inside the station, we had to walk to another line just to find a map. We were able make it to the center of town in a round about manner. <br><br>We made to the Grand Place because we could see the spires from our station, but we couldn't find the cafe we had picked out for lunch (the guidebook only gave an address, street signs are sometimes hard to find as well). There were probably a dozen Italian and Greek places near the square, and the only Belgian places served just beer. Since our time in Brussels was limited and we were starving, we had Greek. After wandering the square for a while, we set off to look for the beer museum.  The guide book map did not show the museum, and there were only some vague directions.  After a little bit of searching with no luck, we decided that we would make sure we had a good map of each city that we tackled. <br><br>We returned to the train station and boarded the next train to Brugge. We saw on the departures board that the train went to Ghent first, then on to Brugge (or so we thought). We were supposed to transfer trains in Ghent, but we ended up riding several stops too far.  By the time we figured out what was going on, our car was deserted, and we got off at a stop called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissegem" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bissegem</a> (we looked it up later, it's almost in France) to try to get on a train going back the opposite direction. The Bissegem station consisted of a stretch of gravel and a bench on either side of the track. We couldn't make head or tail of the posted timetables, but we were able to make some sense of them after talking to nice old lady who spoke a little bit of English. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes to ride one stop back to Kortrjik, where we could catch the train to Brugge (No maps at any of these places). At the Kortrjik station, we waited another 45 minutes for the Brugge train. While we were waiting for the train, we talked to three Canadian girls, one who now lives in Brussels, who were going the same way.  We decided it would be a good idea to follow them. <br><br>We finally made it to Brugge about 3 hours later than we had intended, and surprisingly got on the right bus to the campground, Camping Memling.  After we checked in and set up our tent, we were pretty hungry again.  We walked back towards town and found that the bus had stopped running and everything around us was closed except for a fast food place called <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_(restaurant_chain)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quick</a>.  We reluctantly decided to go in, but soon found the Quick to be an oasis in an otherwise frustrating day. Though we never go to McDonald's or Burger King at home,  the Quick's greasy burger and a fountain drinks (with ice!) were a welcome relief. The Quick also had free wifi so we hung out there a little bit; we checked emails and Facebook, and I posted the Paris entry. We are hoping the campground in Amsterdam has a computer so we can upload the pictures from Amanda's camera to Facebook. So far we have only posted London pictures. <br><br>The historic center of Brugge was very nice. The outside edge is surrounded by a canal and modern suburbs. The inside consists of medieval buildings and churches, the streets are all cobblestone, and there are several smaller canals that weave through the center.  Brugge is  fairly touristy, but it's easy to dodge the crowds by avoiding a couple streets. <br><br>We started by heading into the Markt, the main square of Brugge, which is dominated by the impressive belfry tower. We decided to try the famous Belgian fries we had heard so much about.  At the Friterie, we ended up striking up a conversation with a family from Florida, after we heard them trying to figure out what was so special about the fries. They were plain fries, and the only interesting part was the array of sauces, ranging from gravy to curry ketchup. The oldest son is at FSU, and understandably not a Clemson fan. <br><br>The most interesting place in Brugge was De Halve Maan brewery. We went on a tour that was capped off by some of the brewery's excellent internationally award winning beer. They had versions ranging from 6% to 11% alcohol (Patrick you would love this place).  We also visited a bar that claimed to be the oldest in Brugge. The owners were documented all the way back to 1515. Inside we had some more beers from other parts of Belgium and talked to an older couple from Washington State and a local Belgian man named Jan. Jan has been coming to the bar for 40 years. He showed us a very old book written about the bar; it was kept outside, so it wasn't in great shape. <br><br>We sampled the big 4 of Belgium: beer, chocolate, waffles, and fries. The only real disappointment was the fries. They weren't anything you couldn't get at the Bantam Chef. We decided that Brugge is our favorite stop so far, but we are really looking forward to Amsterdam. </p>
