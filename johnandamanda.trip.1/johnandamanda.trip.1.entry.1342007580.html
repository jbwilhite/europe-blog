      <!-- STORY -->
      <div class="post">
        <p class="entry_text">   Our Italian trip basically consisted of the Cinque Terre and Rome. The Cinque Terre (Five Lands) consists of five tiny towns that cling <br>to the rocky cliffs of the Italian riviera: Monterosso has the only beach, is the biggest and has most of the hotels, Vernazza offers postcard views of its picturesque harbor, Corniglia is the smallest and way up on a hilltop, Manarola is picturesque and has a small harbor with plenty of swimmers and rocks to leap off, and Riomaggiore is the furthest south and seems the most precariously hung from the cliffs. All the towns are connected by a 9km hiking trail that ranges from two hours to 20 minutes between the towns.<br><br>When we decided to fly out earlier, we allocated our last few days as follows: 1 day to get from Switzerland to the Cinque Terre, 1 day in the Cinque Terre, 1/2 a day to get to Rome, a quick stop in Pisa, the rest of the day to see what we can in Rome, then fly out the next morning. I know it sounds crazy to go to Rome for less than 24 hours, but we reasoned that when we come back to Italy we will definitely will see more of Rome, but we can do enough of the Cinque Terre and Pisa and not feel like we have to come back to those.<br><br>It was a real shock to come from Switzerland to Italy. The countries border but couldn't be more different. When we came out of the tunnel into Italy, everything just looked so &#8230; Italian. There's not really any other way to put it. Even in the far north part, the buildings were roofed with red tile, the paint was peeling from the stucco, and the landscape just looked different. Amanda later remarked that everywhere else we've been that reality looks better than the pictures, but in Italy, the pictures look better. Though the most significant change for us was the train system. Swiss trains (Really all the countries so far, but especially Switzerland, Germany, and Austria) are modern, clean, efficient, and most importantly, timed perfectly.<br><br>Our train from Brig stopped in Domodossola and we had to change from to a regional train to continue on to Milan. This train was fine, but there were little things noticeable: the train seemed older, the bathrooms weren't as clean, the doors often jam, etc. When we got to Milan is when we started having problems though. We arrived at s smaller outlying station and needed to get to Milan Central to continue onto Genoa and the Cinque Terre. The boards that displayed departures didn't list anything, but the paper timetables listed a train that runs to the central station every 30 minutes. Seeing one in a few minutes, we had to run to furthest platform, only to see no train. We still have no idea if it left early or never came, but the platform sign displayed the train we needed, even as a different train came and left the platform. <br><br>We decided to go talk to the information desk, where we had to wait 30 minutes in line. The man at the desk told us very rudely to take the metro and not worry about that train. When we got down to the metro area, we attempted to buy metro tickets from the automated machine. The machine had the nerve to tell us that it did not accept coins, and when we tried to use a 20&#8364; bill, it said "Insert Less Money." We were finally able to get tickets from one of the magazine and tobacco kiosks.<br><br>At the Central Station we found out that the big departures screen listed the trains leaving, but not what platform they depart from. Everyone congregates around the screen and when the platform is finally displayed, they rush off to try and board the train in time. The Italian train boards even have a "delay" column, which we didn't see in any other country. We were trying to get on the 18:05 train, but soon realized that the same train that was supposed to leave at 16:05 still hadn't left, and was listed with a 100' delay. We confirmed it was going where we wanted, and got on. The train ended up leaving at 18:00, 115' late. We never saw the 18:05 train. <br><br>Ironically, all the other countries' trains are air conditioned, but the hottest country, Italy, has had the little to no air conditioning on the trains. You basically sit and sweat.  When we finally got to Levanto, a larger town just north of the Cinque Terre, and the location of our campsite, we were relieved, but it was about 9:30 at night and we couldn't find anything to eat, even after getting directions from the guy at campground. He first told us there was one twenty meters on the right, which was just a dried up river bed. When we came back and told him we couldn't find anything, he told us to try 1 kilometer to the left. We could have walked into town, but it was late and we weren't exactly sure where anything was. That night was the low point of our food experiences on the trip; we remembered we had a couple cans of chicken noodle soup left from Munich when Amanda was sick, so we sat on a blanket on the ground and ate it cold. We were laughing because it was so pitiful. <br><br>We got up early the next morning and took the train to Monterosso, the northernmost of the five towns. By train, it takes only about 5 minutes between the towns because there are tunnels, but the hike is about two hours because you have to go up and over the mountains. Monterosso seemed empty at 8:30, but the beach was full when we came back later in the day. We decided to tackle the most daunting hike, the two hour stretch from Monterosso to Vernazza. The first 30 minutes was straight up, then an hour of relatively flat, then another half hour of downhill. The whole Cinque Terre area is a national park, so the trails were pretty popular and well maintained. Several people we saw didn't look at all prepared for the heat and the difficulty of the hike; some were even wearing flip flops.<br><br>The descent down to Vernazza gave us several vantage points that are obviously where the post card pictures are taken. Vernazza, like all the other towns except Monterosso, is car free. Narrow streets wind between the buildings going up the hillside. They are considered streets there, but are about the width of the sidewalk. There wouldn't be any point in even owning a bicycle.  There were a good bit of people sunbathing and swimming from the rocks around the harbor.<br><br>From Vernazza, we took the 5 minute train ride to Corniglia. The train station is about a 10 minute walk to the bottom of the hill the town is on, and then there are roughly 400 steps up to the town. There is even a sign at the bottom encouraging visitors to make the trek up: "You will be amazed by the historical center of Corniglia." We were not amazed. Corniglia was the smallest, least interesting, and hardest to get to of the five towns. Our next stop was Manarola, probably our favorite of the group. The small rocky harbor had spots for sunbathers and jumping rocks for daredevils, and there were plenty of cafes lining the streets. It was a short and easy walk to great postcard vantage point of the town. Manarola and Riomaggiore are connected with a easy paved and flat walk called the Via Dell'Amore (Path of Love). Riomaggiore is the furthest south of the five and our last stopping point. It was set up similarly to Manarola, but not quite as interesting.<br><br>After taking the train back to our base of Levanto, we decided to pick a town to go back to for dinner (we had more money for the eating experiences after we decided to come home earlier). It's only a five to fifteen minute train ride to any of the towns, but in Italy no distance is too short to be exceptionally complicated by train. The bigger stations at least have boards and announcements that tell you what train is leaving from the platform, but at the smaller stations, it is a crap shoot. There is no indication on the train or platform where the train is going. The only thing to do is to find the train we wanted on the paper timetable, stand at the platform indicated and hope the train was there at roughly the right time. This did not work in Levanto. We were at the right platform, but a different train rolled up the correct time for the one we were expecting (we should have known - the trains never show up at the correct time in Italy). So we got on, but were surprised when it starting blowing past all the stops we needed. The first station it did stop was La Spezia, the major town of the region and the next stop after the southernmost town of the Cinque Terre, Riomaggiore.<br><br>There were at least 8 of us in La Spezia of who got on the train thinking it was stopping in the Cinque Terre. We ended up talking to a mother and daughter from Dallas a good bit, and they recommended a restaurant to us in Monterosso. We didn't have any definite dinner plans, so we decided to try it. After waiting on another late train to take us back, we got off and walked to the restaurant. The food was great, but we realized that we were in a bind while we were eating. Several days earlier, our trip debit account was almost empty so we transferred money from our main bank account. Everything would have been fine, but the transfer was taking way longer than expected. Our backup cards were credit cards, but we didn't have pin numbers for them, so we couldn't use the ATMs (Bancomat is the European name). We wanted to catch the early train to Pisa and then to Rome, which was left before our campground opened. We needed to check out, and to make that train we had to check out that night. <br><br>I remembered that the campground only accepted cash, and we had no cash and no way of getting any. We had some backup USD that we could exchange at a bank in the morning, but that wouldn't get us on the early train out. About that time, the mother and daughter from the train who suggested the restaurant walked in, said hi to us and found a seat. I felt bad for asking, but since we were in a bind, I asked them if they minded exchanging 50 Euros for $80 USD. They were nice and helped us out, but we took basically all of their cash. We gave them a great rate though: 50 Euros are worth about $65 USD.<br><br>We knew our campground closed at 11pm, and after waiting on a late train back to Levanto, we barely made it back before closing. But it turned out that the guy at the desk was only a night watchman and couldn't check us out; the office actually closed at 9pm. So we were forced to wait until the office opened back up at 8:15 the next morning, and we got on a 9am train to Pisa. Though if we hadn't had the USD to exchange, we might still be in Levanto waiting on that bank transfer (it finally did go through after we got home - big help there).<br><br>It amazed us how little prepared some of the travelers we ran across were. That night, after we talked to the night watchman, a couple college age American guys strolled into the campground at about 11pm. They asked the night watchman if they could camp there, and he told them sure, they could set up and pay in the morning. They then revealed that they didn't have a tent and asked if they could rent one. He looked at them like they were crazy and told them no (some of the campgrounds do rent tents, but I don't know why they would wander through a town just hoping to find one in the middle of the night). He then informed them that all the hotels in town were probably full and they would most likely have to try somewhere else.<br><br>The day before, when we first got off the train in Levanto about 9pm and were looking for our campground, we ran across another backpacker. We asked him if he knew where the campground was. He told us he didn't even know if there were any campgrounds in town, but he wanted to stay in one. Apparently he just randomly got of the train hoping to find a campground. I was aware of three, but only had a mental map of where they were. He asked for the most beautiful one, so I directed him toward the one closest to the beach. Traveling in Europe is stressful enough when you have an idea of what you're doing, we have no idea how these people managed to stay sane (or where they slept!) just wandering around.<br><br>We enjoyed the Cinque Terre, but were glad to be moving on to Rome. We had to change trains in Pisa, so we decided to see the tower. It is about a 10min bus ride from the train station, and when we got off the bus we entered the most touristy area of the whole trip. The tower area is totally lined with souvenir shops, and there are hordes of people holding their arms out to "prop" up the tower. Some people were even sitting on each others' shoulders trying to make a cliche shot unique. It was a giant mess, so we took the cliche pictures just to prove that we had been and got out of there. The bus to take us back to the train station was late, and we only made our train by a few seconds (there wasn't another for two hours).<br><br>The train to Rome was roughly four hours long with no air conditioning. We were hot and surrounded by loud Italian kids playing Uno. We booked a hostel for our last European night at a place near the Rome Termini station so we could save some time by not walking so much. We didn't get to Rome until around 5pm and our flight was at 11:52 the next morning.  Rome wasn't built in a day, and it certainly can't be seen in half of one. We managed to see the outside of the Colosseum, the outside of the Roman Forum, the outside of Circus Maximus, and the one fountain closest to the train station. We took some pictures to prove we were actually there, but we will have to come back to really see the city sometime. We wanted to see the Vatican as well, but it was so hot and the subways so crowded, we decided to wait til next time (sorry Nancy).<br><br>The Rome Airport ran about as smoothly as the trains. For some odd reason they decided that all American (and Israeli for some reason) flights should leave from Terminal 5. They don't tell you that T5 isn't connected to the airport at all, but a 10 minute shuttle ride from the main terminals. At T5, we checked our bags and went through security, but then were bused right back to the main terminal. Amanda bought a really fitting shirt at the Rome hostel, the back of it says something like this:<br><br><b>Heaven is where</b><br>The police are British<br>The cooks Spanish<br>The mechanics German<br>The lovers Italian<br>and it is all organized by the Swiss<br><br><b>Hell is where</b><br>The cooks are British<br>The mechanics Spanish<br>The police German<br>The lovers Swiss<br>and it is all organized by the Italians<br><br>The whole airport was a mess, but we finally did make it home. 5 weeks is a long time to live the gypsy lifestyle that we did, but we really got used to it. It was bittersweet because we had such a great time and met so many interesting people, but we were ready to come home. We missed out on some of Italy that we had planned, but that's just a good reason to plan another trip, but it won't be in the middle of the summer! By the end, we could navigate train stations and public transportation with the best of them. Even Amanda, who had first left the EST zone only two years ago, was moving through Europe with ease (she has common sense, a lot of travelers we met didn't).<br><br>I have really enjoyed writing the blog, and I appreciate all the feedback and comments I have received. It seems like everyone has really liked reading it. I looked back on some of the first posts, and it's really interesting how much longer and more detailed I got. I think there is a direct correlation between the train distance to the next city and how long the blog post is though! I calculated that I wrote roughly 15,000 words, the vast majority using one finger on my iPhone (Travel Pod really needs to let their app turn sideways - at least then I could use two fingers). I will miss writing the blog, but now we go back to our lives and they're not as interesting!<br><br>Thanks for reading,<br>John and Amanda </p>
