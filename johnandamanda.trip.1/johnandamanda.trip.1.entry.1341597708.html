      <!-- STORY -->
      <div class="post">
        <p class="entry_text">   Switzerland was the one country we were the most excited about on this trip, and we can say that it certainly did not disappoint. Whether we were up at top of Alps or down in valleys, the views were breathtaking.  We are already planning out trip back!<br><br>We left Munich very early and barely caught the 7:17 train to Zurich.  Our original plan was to go all the way to Lauterbrunnen on the train that day, stopping in Zurich, Lucerne and Interlaken. We knew we wanted to stop and at least see a little bit of each of those cities. We ended up booking a hostel for one night in Interlaken, because the forecast was calling for heavy rain in Lauterbrunnen, and we are getting tired of setting up and taking down our tent in the rain. Lauterbrunnen is only about 20 minutes from Interlaken, but the valleys in the Alps each have their own "microclimates." It can be pouring rain in Lauterbrunnen but perfectly sunny in Grindelwald, one valley over.<br><br>We first stopped in Zurich, but for only less than an hour. We grabbed lunch in the station, and got our first shock of how steep the Swiss prices were going to be.  After we scraped most of the stick of butter that was on each sandwich, we walked a little ways down the Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich's main shopping street, and then back. It is nice how compact and organized Swiss cities are. We tried to stop for a just a couple hours in Brussels and basically got lost and didn't see much. Lucerne was the same way as Zurich.  We walked from the train station through the Kapellbr&#252;cke, a famous covered wooden bridge with paintings dating back to the 1300s, on to the old town and circled back. We only spent about an hour and a half in Lucerne, but we saw the heart of the city. <br><br>Interlaken is quite a different place. The hotels are still there from its days as popular resort town for the wealthy in the early part of the last century, but now it is more of a base for extreme sports. At one point we saw 10 paragliders airborne over the city at the same time. Every shop you walk in offers to book your extreme sports adventures, from bungee jumping to skydiving out of a helicopter, for a hefty fee. I would have been more likely to go paragliding than Amanda, but there was no way she would let me go. She doesn't even like the cable car rides. <br><br>Our "hostel" was the only place we could find with openings in all of Interlaken, but it was basically a grouping of large tents. Our tent had six bunks, a plywood floor and a light. We made a good decision because it did rain pretty heavily that night and most of the whole next day. Surprisingly, a month of mostly sleeping on the ground hasn't really bothered us, but packing up and carrying around a wet tent has not been fun. We made it to our campground in Lauterbrunnen pretty early in the day, and set our tent up before it started raining again. For reference, Lauterbrunnen is a small town at the entrance of Lauterbrunnen Valley, a spectacularly huge U-shaped valley with literally hundreds of waterfalls cascading down. The largest is Trummelbach Falls, but it isn't visible from the valley; it is inside the walls of the mountain. We could have seen it for 22 CHF (Swiss Francs - note: 100 CHF is 108 USD, so pretty similar in value), but we decided to skip it.  The second largest falls was right beside our campground, the wispy Staubbach Falls.  The water becomes mist because it takes so long to fall to the valley floor.  It does somehow manage to collect at the bottom, but depending on the wind, the waterfall can be blown fifty to sixty feet in either direction. <br><br>Above Lauterbrunnen, only accessible by special trains and cable cars are two ski towns, M&#252;rren and Wengen, and the little village of Gimmelwald.  Towering above the valley are the spectacular snowy peaks of the Eiger, the M&#246;nch, and the Jungfrau (the Ogre, the Monk, and the Young Girl). There are hundreds of other smaller peaks, but the three are what the area is known for. Lauterbrunnen valley is in the center of Switzerland, and Switzerland is in the middle of the Alps. It really feels like we were in the absolute heart of the Alps. It is a truly spectacular place. We probably took as many pictures in one day here as the rest of the trip combined. We would marvel at every view, only for it to be topped by rounding the next corner.<br><br>Our campground was very large and very nice. They had a restaurant and a store that wasn't much smaller than the average European grocery store.  The only minus is that they charged outrageous fees for wifi and Internet access, 5 CHF for 30 minutes of use. We soon found a cafe called Airtime in town, less than 10 min walk, that gave out their wifi password if you bought anything. Not only was it a cafe, but an adventure booking center and laundromat. <br><br>Swiss francs are the most interesting currency we have encountered yet. The bills look like they were designed by someone on some powerful hallucinogenics and the coins feel like the quality of Chuck-E-Cheese tokens. In the US, the highest value coin we regularly use is 25&#162;, and Euros go up to 2&#8364; coins. The Swiss use coins all the way up to 5 CHF. It is a weird feeling to pay for an entire meal with a few coins. <br><br>We soon discovered that our campground had bungalows that are a popular spot for tour buses.  Not the elderly or Asian buses like we have become used to, but a young party bus company called Contiki (they say on the buses that they are the most popular tour for 18-35 year olds. There were between 2 and 4 buses there each night. The crowds seemed to be mostly Australian, but there were some Americans too. The Contiki'ers we talked to generally assumed we were on one of the buses, and seemed amazed when they found out we had planned our own trip and were doing our own thing.  We were concerned, because when we first got to Lauterbrunnen, it was raining and the visibility was very low. We found out that one of the Contiki groups had taken the train up to the Jungfraujoch, a train station 3000  meters up between the Jungfrau and the M&#246;nch. At the top they were only greeted by thick fog and sub freezing temperatures. There budget must have been a lot bigger than ours, because they didn't seem to care that they had spent 150 CHF to be in a cloud. One guy's quote was "Well the pictures inside the building looked nice.". <br><br>We were concerned we would have bad weather for whatever we decided to do the next day. We started planning for good and bad weather while watching the Wimbledon Semifinals, that saw Roger Federer and Andy Murray advance to the finals. We got into a conversation with an older English couple about how the English support the Scottish athletics ( Andy Murray is Scottish and the first Brit make it to the finals in 75 years), but the Scots hope the English always lose. The husband then went on to tell me how great American Music is; he is a big fan of Irving Berlin, and he doesn't like the newfangled stuff like The Beatles. After his little rant, he told us that they had been coming to Lauterbrunnen for 50 years, and we soon figured out that he was a walking encyclopedia of the region. He explained the best trains and cable cars to get to the most spectacular views in the area. There are dozens of cable car and train lines in the Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald valleys. They are run by a private company and not covered on our Eurail passes, but we did get a 25% discount. We started on a pretty tight budget and the unexpected costs are really starting to add up.<br><br>We woke up the next morning very excited to see blue skies. We started off by taking a cable car and train up to M&#252;rren. As soon as we left the valley floor, we were greeted by spectacular views of the three peaks. We had decided that we would take the cable car up to the Schilthorn (the other major excursion besides the Jungfraujoch - but for closer to half the price) if it was a perfect day. Since it was about as good of weather as we could ask for, we took the cable car up from M&#252;rren to the Schilthorn, about 3000 meters or 10,000 feet above sea level. As soon as we stepped out of the cable car, it felt like we were in a different world. They say on a clear day you can see as far as the Black Forest in Germany, but we had some clouds. I'm not sure how far we could see, but it seemed incredibly far. The Schilthorn also gives amazing views of the Jungfrau, M&#246;nch, Eiger and hundreds of other surrounding peaks.<br><br>The Schilthorn is capped by the famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria. We were there early enough to enjoy the breakfast buffet, while rotating around the 360 degree panorama views. It was interesting because only the outer seating area revolved, not the center or the windows. It was difficult to find our seats after we went to the buffet, and if you sat anything on the window ledge it would stay behind while you rotated onwards. Someone was even writing notes and passing the butter this way.<br><br>The Piz Gloria has no shame in admitting it was a James Bond filming location. They sell many 007 souvenirs, there are 007 decals on the windows, and the waiters even have 007 embroidered on their shirts. What they don't tell you is that the movie was In Her Majesty's Secret Service, the one James Bond movie starring George Lazenby. Have you ever heard of George Lazenby? Of course not! George Lazenby's grand kids don't even know he was James Bond. Excited tourists go to the small theater downstairs that shows clips from the movie, expecting to see Sean Connery or Roger Moore, only to walk out saying, "Who was that guy?".<br><br>There are a few intense hiking trails down from the summit, and we walked a little ways down each.  The view from here was so spectacular, it would almost be worth the cost of the whole trip just to be on the Schilthorn. On our way back to the cable car, we saw a paraglider putting on his gear. We, along with some others, helped hold his parachute up while he was preparing to take off.  I don't know how long it took him to travel the odd 2000 or so meters down to the valley floor, but I'm pretty sure we passed him as we went down in the cable car 15 minutes later.<br><br>Once we were back in M&#252;rren, we set out to hike the "North Face Trail" to Gimmelwald. I'm not sure why it's called that, as it's not on the north face of anything, but it was a great hike nonetheless. We spent the first portion hiking through a dense pine forest, but the majority of the trail was through cow pastures. Switzerland is known for its dairy products, and these types of fields are everywhere, even up on the side of a mountain. One portion we had difficulty even getting through because of all the cows in the way. Amanda even got shocked by an electric fence. All along the trail were little cottages, farmhouses I guess, that seemed like you could rent. One had a group of college looking guys sitting around drinking beer. I'm sure it would be a very interesting experience to stay at one of these, the only way in and out is a 30 min to 1 hr walk to town, totally surrounded by the Alps. We even saw a couple of little guesthouse/restaurants along the path.  I have no idea how a place with no roads runs a restaurant, but they do.<br><br>About half way to Gimmelwald, we decided to climb a "small" mountain named Bryndli that over looks the village and valley below. I guess our eyes were bigger than our legs, because we only made it up 3/4 of the way up. We thought we were almost at the summit, but when we rounded what we thought was the top, we saw there was still a good bit to go. We didn't pack enough food and water, so we headed back down, and started the hour descent to Gimmelwald. It's tough to walk a steep descent for two hours, and we could really feel it in our legs by the time we got down. Along the way we stumbled upon a really great waterfall (it's still amazing how many waterfalls are in the valley).  After we ate, we had planned on continuing the walk down to the valley floor to Stechelberg, but we opted for the cable car instead. Then we walked along the river part of the way back to Lauterbrunnen, and caught the bus back for the rest.<br><br>We were very sore the next day and contemplated spending it in Lauterbrunnen, but the weather forecast was poor, and it even rained on us as we packed up (what a surprise). So we decided to head on to Zermatt. The ticket checkers on the trains generally barely glance at our railpasses, and we have never had to show our passports to actually prove they are ours, but we had problems on the Interlaken to Spiez train. At only 20min, it was the shortest train ride yet, but the ticket lady looked at our railpasses for awhile, then said "One minute" and took them to the front of the train.  The train was in the act of stopping as she walked away and we needed to get off. We ran her down and told her we needed to transfer there. She mumbled something about how our passes weren't complete, and told us to go to the ticket office. We said ok, and proceeded to get on our next train. Nobody has questioned the passes since. <br><br>We knew that the trains in Lauterbrunnen were private, and our passes didn't cover them, but nowhere did we see that our passes didn't cover the train from Visp to Zermatt. On the train, the ticket checker informed us that we had to pay 51 CHF each to get to Zermatt. You think there would be someone to check tickets before you get on the train, but it is easy to get on a train you're not supposed to. The $100  we had to pay was really the straw that broke our budget's back. Little (or big) unexpected charges have really added up (more on this later). <br><br>Zermatt is a really interesting town. My Mom remembers it as a quaint little mountain town, but in the past 30 years, it has become a major ski resort. In the summer, the main street is still bustling with tourists, hikers, and climbers, but the outskirts feel like a ghost town. There are no cars here, only funny miniaturized electric trucks that mainly serve as taxis and hotel shuttles. The town's main attraction is the amazing Matterhorn mountain. Unlike Lauterbrunnen, which is surrounded by dozens of huge mountains, Zermatt is surrounded by hills (that would be mountains in SC) and the Matterhorn towers above it all. It's craggy, sheer faces are really a sight to behold.<br><br>For those Bachelor fans who are reading, we have been to the final two locations of the last season, Interlaken and Zermatt. Coincidently we also left London and Prague the day after each of those episodes of the current season of The Bachelorette aired. With our downtime, we have been keeping up with our reality TV the best we can with spotty Internet and the ABC app on our phones.  I think Emily is going to pick Sean, but Amanda thinks Jef. We haven't seen the latest episode yet though, so don't ruin it for us.<br><br>The population of Zermatt seemed about 10% permanent locals, 10% hardcore hikers and climbers, 80% Asian tourists, and then us. The Asian groups were very entertaining because they were totally decked out in very nice hiking gear, but we never saw any of them out on the trails. They were using their trekking poles just to walk out of the sidewalk.<br><br>One odd thing we have noticed everywhere, but especially in Zermatt, is the startling number of people walking around with camcorders. They walk the streets with the camera rolling and film every little bit of everything. They only see Europe through the little screen on their video camera. One guy was just standing and filming the Matterhorn, like something amazing was going to happen, but the mountain just sat there, looking the same as it has for thousands of years. I do love that my phone can take good quality video, and I have filmed quite a few things, but it's always short videos of things a photo doesn't really do justice. <br><br>While we were in Zermatt, we had to make the tough decision of scheduling home an earlier flight. We are about 70% of the way through, but we have already burned through 100% of what we budgeted for the trip. We could afford to finish, but we don't want to be totally broke when we come home. Both our parents have offered to help us, but it's not totally about the money. It is more a combination of money, costs, weather, and other general annoyances. The most annoying thing is that it is so expensive to do anything, no matter who's money it is. That's not to say we haven't enjoyed it, because the trip has been great, but it's just little things start to add up, and we are ready to come home. We have tried so hard to save money, but it is impossible. It's no fun to skip eating at a restaurant and buying food at a grocery store, only to realize that we spent 80% of the restaurant cost. Even if we had triple the budget, I couldn't justify spending money on what some of this stuff costs. In Zermatt, albeit an expensive resort town, an 8oz Coke at a restaurant, with no refills, costs over $4.50. Not everywhere is that bad, but it is still expensive.  One meal we bought and cooked in Lauterbrunnen cost of over $20 just for spaghetti, one small chicken breast, vegetables, and tomato sauce. We have been gone long enough that the way we do things has started to feel like a way of life and less like a vacation. It's fine for a while, but it is starting to wear on us.<br><br>The camping and moving around has been totally fine. We aren't tired of sleeping in the tent, but the weather has dampened on our spirits somewhat. At the start of the trip, we didn't see the sun until the second day in Copenhagen; that's 6 countries we travelled through under clouds. While walking around the city in cloudy, cold and occasionally rainy weather isn't too bad, packing a wet tent and never being able to dry clothes has not been fun. Every European we have talked to has remarked about how exceptionally wet and cool this summer has been. <br><br>We are finishing with a blitz of the two places we wanted to see most in Italy, Cinque Terre and Rome. Our next trip to Italy trip will have a bigger budget to see the places we are missing and eat more of the food.  We are cutting out 12 days, which is probably about the average Italian vacation. We are already planning our trip back, but it won't be in July. We can already tell that Italy is very hot and very crowded.  Look out for Cinque Terre and Rome posts soon! </p>
