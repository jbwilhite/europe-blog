Welcome to your TravelPod archive
---------------------------------

With TravelPod coming to an end in 2017, we wanted to make sure you had a copy
of your blogs, photos, and address book for safekeeping, viewing later, and
even importing into a new blogging platform (such as WordPress) if you wish.



=================================
BROWSE YOUR BLOG ON YOUR COMPUTER
=================================

Open the file /johnandamanda/johnandamanda.profile.html by double-clicking on it.

You'll see your profile page. You can browse your TravelPod content offline from this page.



=============================
IMPORT YOUR BLOG TO WORDPRESS
=============================

XML files are in the /johnandamanda/XML-WordPress/ folder.

There is one xml file for each of your trips. More details below.



--------------------------------
What is included in this archive
--------------------------------

This folder contains two versions of your blog:

- An HTML version that is entirely self-contained and can be viewed offline.

- An XML version that can be imported into another blogging platform such as
  WordPress.


----------------------------
How to view your blog (HTML)
----------------------------

Your TravelPod HTML archive is build like a mini website.
You can view it in a browser, without an internet connection.

In this archive folder, find and open the file named:

  johnandamanda.profile.html

Normally this will open when you double-click on it. This is your profile page.
It shows your cover photo, personal details and links to each and every one of
your trips. From there, you can navigate through your blogs, entries and photos
similar to what you're used to on TravelPod.


-----------------------------
How to import your blog (XML)
-----------------------------

Your TravelPod XML archive is located in:

  XML-WordPress/

We've created one XML file for each one of your trips. These XML files can
be imported directly with the official WordPress Import module.

For further help and details on importing XML into WordPress, please contact
your WordPress site administrator or visit:

==========================================
Technical Details: File & Folder structure
==========================================

At the root directory of your TravelPod archive, you will find:

- The HTML file for your Profile & Address Book, with links to each Trip's HTML
- One-or-Many folder(s), one per each of your Trip(s)
- One folder with the XML of each trip

Files and folders are named after your TravelPod Username, as well as unique
tags given to each Trip and Entry:

- <UserID>  e.g. "johndoe"
- <TripID>  e.g. 23
- <EntryID> e.g. 1416416551


We've tried to keep things neatly organized into various folders.

This should make it easier to find Photos associated with a specific Trip or
Entry.

- Each trip folder is named <UserID>.trip.<TripID>
  e.g.  /johndoe/johndoe.trip.13/

- Each trip's HTML file is named <UserID>.trip.<TripID>.html
  e.g.  /johndoe/johndoe.trip.13/johndoe.trip.13.html

- Each entry's HTML file is named <UserID>.trip.<TripID>.entry.<EntryID>.html
  e.g.  /johndoe/johndoe.trip.13/johndoe.trip.13.entry.1416416551.html

- Each photo is named <TripID>.<EntryID>.<ImageTitle>.*
  e.g.  /johndoe/johndoe.trip.13/images/13.1416416551.big-blue-mountain.jpg
  e.g.  /johndoe/johndoe.trip.13/images/13.1416416551.a-fun-dance.mov.flv

- Each trip's XML file is named <UserID>.trip.<TripID>.xml
  e.g.  /johndoe/XML-WordPress/johndoe.trip.13.xml
